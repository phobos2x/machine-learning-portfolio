# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning project portfolio!  
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects focused on regression, classification, and natural language processing (NLP).

Each project demonstrates my ability to perform:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., TF-IDF, SMOTE)
- Model building and evaluation (regression and classification)
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Model saving for deployment

## Projects

### 1. California Housing Price Prediction
- **Problem:** Predict house prices based on census data.
- **Techniques:** Feature engineering, Random Forest Regression, RMSE evaluation.
- **Note:** Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained model `.pkl` is not uploaded. It can be easily regenerated by running the notebook.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction (MSFT)
- **Problem:** Predict stock prices using historical data.
- **Techniques:** Regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, SVM), RMSE evaluation, Ridge model saved.

### 3. Heart Failure Prediction
- **Problem:** Predict death events based on clinical features.
- **Techniques:** Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost), SMOTE for imbalance handling, ROC-AUC evaluation.

### 4. Spam Detector System
- **Problem:** Classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
- **Techniques:** NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest), ROC-AUC evaluation.
