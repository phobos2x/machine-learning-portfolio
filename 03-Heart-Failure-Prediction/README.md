This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure events based on clinical patient data.

- Explored class imbalance and feature correlations.
- Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
- Random Forest selected as best model based on AUC.
